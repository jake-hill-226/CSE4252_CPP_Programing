Algorithm increases revenue by 10 percent in six months^M
Simchi-Levi developed a machine-learning algorithm, which won the INFORMS Revenue Management and Pricing Section Practice Award, and first implemented it at online retailer Rue La La.^M
The initial research goal was to reduce inventory, but what the company ended up with was â<80><9c>a cutting-edge, demand-shaping application that has a tremendous impact on the retailerâ<80><99>s bottom line,â<80><9d> Simchi-Levi says.^M
Rue La Laâ<80><99>s big challenge was pricing on items that have never been sold before and therefore required a pricing algorithm that could set higher prices for some first-time items and lower prices for others.^M
Within six months of implementing the algorithm, it increased Rue La Laâ<80><99>s revenue by 10 percent.^M

Forecast, learn, optimize^M
Simchi-Levi's process involves three steps for generating better price predictions:^M
Predicting consumer demand at Groupon^M
Groupon has a huge product portfolio and launches thousands of new deals every day, offering them for only a short time period. Since Groupon has such a ^M
short sales period, predicting demand was a big problem and forecasting near impossible. Applying Simchi-Levi<92>s approach to this use case began by ^M
