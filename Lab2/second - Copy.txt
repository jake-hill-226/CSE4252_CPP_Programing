Predicting consumer demand at Groupon
Groupon has a huge product portfolio and launches thousands of new deals every day, offering them for only a short time period. Since Groupon has such a 
short sales period, predicting demand was a big problem and forecasting near impossible. Applying Simchi-Levi’s approach to this use case began by 
generating multiple demand functions. By then applying a test price and observing customers’ decisions, insights were gleaned on how much was sold — 
information that could identify the demand function closest to the level of sales at the learning price. This was the final demand-price function used, 
and it was used as the basis for optimizing price during the optimization period. Analysis of the results from the field experiment showed that this new 
approach increased Groupon’s revenue by about 21 percent but had a much bigger impact on low-volume deals. For deals with fewer bookings per day than the 
median, the average increase in revenue was 116 percent, while revenue increased only 14 percent for deals with more bookings per day than the median.

Potential to disrupt consumer banking and insurance
The ability to automate pricing enables companies to optimize pricing for more products than most organizations currently find possible. This method has 
also been used for a bricks-and-mortar application by applying the method to a company’s promotion and pricing, in various retail channels, with similar 
results.
“I am very pleased that our pricing algorithm can achieve such positive results in a short timeframe,” Simchi-Levi says. 
“We expect that this method will soon be used not only in retail but also in the consumer banking industry. Indeed, my team at MIT has developed related 
methods that have recently been applied in the airline and insurance industries.”
